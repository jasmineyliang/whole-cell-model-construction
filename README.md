# whole-cell-model-construction-

## Overview
This repository contains the homework project focused on understanding the construction and application of high-quality whole-cell models in scientific research.

### 1. Historical Challenges 
Historically, what two factors have held back scientists from constructing high-quality whole-cell models?

### 2. Model Construction Strategy 
What general strategy was used to construct the model in this paper?

### 3. Model Validation 
After it was constructed, how was the model validated experimentally? Is there enough data to validate all the parameters defined in the model?

### 4. Predictive Biology Example 
Give an example of how this model was used for the purposes of predictive biology and explain and interpret the results.
